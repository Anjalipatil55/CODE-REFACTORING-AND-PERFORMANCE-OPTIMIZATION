# CODE-REFACTORING-AND-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION

# 📖 Project Overview
This task focuses on analyzing an existing open-source project and improving its code readability, maintainability, and performance through systematic refactoring and optimization techniques.
The goal is to enhance the project without altering its external behavior, while making the codebase cleaner, faster, and easier to understand.

# 🎯 Objective
Study an existing open-source codebase
Identify code smells and inefficiencies
Improve code readability and structure
Optimize performance where applicable
Document all changes and their impact

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
(Modify based on your project
Programming Language: Python
Framework / Library: Flask
Tools: Git, VS Code
Techniques: Refactoring, Optimization, Code Review


# Refactoring Techniques Applied
1. Code Readability Improvements
Renamed variables and functions to meaningful names
Removed unused variables and commented code
Added proper comments and docstrings
Followed consistent coding standards (PEP 8)

2. Code Structure Optimization
Split large functions into smaller reusable functions
Improved file organization and modularity
Reduced duplicate code using helper functions

3. Performance Optimization
